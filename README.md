## Imports
<br>This section offers a brief overview of common imports and their uses.<br><br>

- ### Pathlib

  Pathlib is a module that offers a simpler way to work with file systems and
  paths by representing them as objects, allowing for easy manipulation and
  platform-independent operations.

  - #### Path
   
    Path refers to the main class provided by the pathlib module. It
    represents a file system path as an object, enabling straightforward
    manipulation and operations on paths in a cross-platform manner.

    ```
    from pathlib import Path

    path = Path(r"C:\Users\(...)\data.csv")
    ```
  
- ### Pandas

  Pandas is a powerful open-source Python library widely used for data
  manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions to
  efficiently work with structured data, such as tables and time series,
  making it an essential tool for data scientists and analysts. Pandas allows
  for easy data cleaning, transformation, aggregation, and exploration, and
  offers various methods for handling missing data and dealing with diverse
  data formats. It also integrates well with other libraries in the Python
  ecosystem, making it a popular choice for data analysis tasks. It is
  generally aliased and imported as "pd"
  
  ```
  import pandas as pd
  ```


- ### Matplotlib

  Matplotlib is a popular Python library used for creating static, animated,
  and interactive visualizations. It provides a wide range of plotting
  functionalities, allowing users to generate various types of charts,
  graphs, and plots with customizable features. Matplotlib is highly
  flexible, enabling users to create publication-quality visualizations for
  data analysis, scientific research, and data exploration tasks.
  
  - #### .pyplot
  
    .pyplot is a function provided by the matplotlib module that offers
    easy access to various plot types, including line, bar, box, scatter,
    and more. It is generally aliased and imported as "plt"
    ```
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ```
  - #### %matplotlib inline
    
    The %matplotlib inline command is a specific Jupyter Notebook magic
    command used to enable the inline display of matplotlib plots within the
    notebook itself. By using this command, any plots generated by matplotlib
    will be shown directly in the output cell of the notebook, allowing for a
    seamless integration of code and visualizations in the notebook
    environment.
    ```
    %matplotlib inline
    ```
- ### Seaborn
  
  Seaborn is a Python library for creating visually attractive statistical
  visualizations. It simplifies the process of generating common plots and
  provides additional features like color control and categorical data
  visualization. It is generally aliased and imported as "sns"
  
  ```
  import seaborn as sns
  ```
- ### Chardet
  
  Chardet is a Python library for automatic character encoding detection. It
  helps determine the encoding of text or files when not explicitly specified.
  
  ```
  import chardet

  df = pd.read_csv(path, encoding="Windows-1252") 
  
  # Sets encoding paramater to Windows-1252
  ```

- ### Calendar
  
  The "calendar" module in Python provides various functionalities for working with dates, months, and years. It allows you to generate calendars, manipulate dates, and perform calculations related to dates and time.

  With the calendar module, you can:

  * Generate calendars for a specific month or an entire year.
  * Access information about weekdays, weekends, and leap years.
  * Determine the day of the week for a given date.
  * Perform calculations like adding or subtracting days, weeks, or months from a given date.
  * Format dates in different ways, such as displaying them as strings or extracting specific components like the day, month, or year.
   
   
  The calendar module is useful for tasks that involve date and time
  calculations, scheduling, or displaying dates in a structured manner.

  ```
  import calendar
  ```
